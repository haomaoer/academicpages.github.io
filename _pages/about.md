This is Yuhao Yi's homepage. I am a postdoctoral researcher in CS at RPI, advised by <u><a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~pattes3/">Dr. Stacy Patterson</a></u>. I got my PhD from CS at Fudan University in 2019, advised by <u><a href="http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/zhangzz/">Prof. Zhongzhi Zhang</a></u>. My research interests include network science, distributed control, and spectral graph theory.

I'm looking for postdoc opportunities. Here is my <u><a href="https://yhyi15.github.io/files/yhy_cv2.pdf">CV</a></u>.
