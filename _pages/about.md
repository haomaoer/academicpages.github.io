This is Yuhao Yi's homepage. I am a postdoctoral researcher in CS at RPI, advised by Dr. Stacy Patterson. I got my PhD from CS at Fudan University in 2019, advised by Dr. Zhongzhi Zhang. My research interests include network science, distributed control, and spectral graph theory.

I'm looking for postdoc opportunities. Here is my <u><a href="https://yhyi15.github.io/files/yhy_cv2.pdf">CV</a></u>.
